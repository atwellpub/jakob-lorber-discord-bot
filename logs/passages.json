Amen. I say this to you, now coming on the clouds of the heavens. Amen, Amen, Amen.",

The answer is: Because no moon may rotate on its own axis, and this is because the attraction of the earth or of any planet would still be too powerfully at work in the range of its moon. Now, if the moon rotated on its own axis, and as slow as this rotation might be, such a rotation, to begin with, would enhance the attracting power of the planet in such a ratio that the rotation of the moon would be proportional to the rotation of the planet, that is: If the time of the moon’s rotation were to approximate the time of the earth’s rotation in such a way that it would rotate around its axis in about the same time as the planet, by virtue of this increasing gravitational attraction of the planet, soon one part after another would detach from the moon and fall to the earth. Such a slow rotation as the planet’s would not serve the moon well with regard to the proportional distribution of air, water and thus also fire, and all of this would still be as it is now, namely on the side that is opposite to the planet. For the water, the air and the fire must be driven around on a celestial body with relative speed through the protruding mountains; otherwise, by virtue of centrifugal force and their own fluid gravity, these elements so necessary for organic life would accumulate on the side opposite the central body."

And he does that only like a careless cook who often thoughtlessly throws some salt into the soup because she is used to doing it like this, or in order to at least be able to say that she has salted the soup, even if it often does not taste better than a mere, tasteless water without oil and salt. Verily, I say to you, such worship will not fatten your God nor will your life thereby become stronger, but only the life of your wooden crucifixes in your homes and rooms which show you physically the enormous pitifulness and how much your worship and religious service resembles those of the Jews. At least they crucified the Living One, whereas you have been too lazy and indifferent for this work for a long time and content yourself with somebody selling you such an already accomplished wooden crucifixion which is then also completely suitable to receive, in My place, the morsels of your worship. Oh you fools! You worship the sculpted wood or stone or metal in the same way as a dog worships a corner stone at which a predecessor sniffed. You press your lips at the wood and think you have served Me or actually worshipped Me head over heels when you have babbled one so-called Lord's Prayer and one Hail Mary, or when you have spent about an hour thoughtlessly and showily dressed with a gilded prayer book in your hands in a church made out of stones and filled with carvings. Oh you fools! Do you really think that I am in the wood, in the stone, in the metal, or in any other vain carvings from the hands of the carpenters, sculptors, wood turners, locksmiths, blacksmiths, bricklayers and painters? Verily, I say to you: All those worshipers, if they do not change their ways on earth, must someday attend school on the moon for a long time. There they must, under severe hardship, experience spiritually and physically that the living God is not at all pleased with such preposterous worship which is much worse than that of the blind pagans who, even if not out of love, at least out of fear offer a serious sacrifice to their idols. By contrast, you worship Me, the living God, as though I either did not exist at all or were seriously made of wood, or perhaps a little bit better, either freshly baked from flour or day-old.",

Don’t these worldly beings devote all their attention to their dirty body? Some of them are always busily worried about the rags in which they should wrap the midden of their mind. Still others are anxious to prepare all kinds of delicious food for themselves, then to pack it into the stomach as a veritable workshop of death. Yet others are preoccupied with their grand house, the beautiful, magnificent furnishings, soft chairs and couches, splendid tables and excessively soft beds in order to lounge on them so much more easily and more comfortably by day and by night and to carefully pay attention that their inner, most beloved friend, the stomach, should never suffer from any insulting pressure or even a somewhat painful pinch. These friends of the stomach are also very afraid of the sunrays, and therefore they take care that indeed not too much sunlight falls into the room through the windows which they therefore also cover with all kinds of rags. Don’t you notice that such people, already here, have a certain relationship to the cave squatters of the moon who, because they can’t build themselves such magnificent houses anymore and are no longer able to hang curtains in front of their windows and therefore have to escape the sunrays by fleeing into their caves where they also linger until the late afternoon, just as the easy-going and wallowing people on this earth, who, coming from their rooms, board their well-cushioned and swinging carriages in order to have what they think is an exercise conducive to their physical health? And again, there are others on this earth who don’t know any more important business than to practice usury with money and other material assets. And there are still others who have no other thought than to do themselves up in any possible way, which diligence is especially performed by the female gender and namely with the sole intention of thereby duping some young, inexperienced man and to thoroughly deceive him. Of course, no righteous maiden would do such a thing. For when a maiden realizes her real inner value and, out of that, also the value of her fellow being, ask yourself, would she then possibly do herself up in order to deceive somebody by means of herself and to act like the Jews who polish the bad metal in order to sell it to the fools as gold? I say: She will not do such things because she very well recognizes that she is no fake, but true gold which does not require a fool, but an intelligent man who will right away identify the gold and will take it for the fair price. And behold, I could still point out many of such worldly people to you; but it is not necessary for the enlightenment of the topic."
